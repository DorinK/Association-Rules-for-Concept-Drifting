# Association-Rules-for-Concept-Drifting
Final project in 'Tabular Data Science' course by Dr. Amit Somech at Bar-Ilan University.


## ConceptDriftsFinder

`ConceptsDriftsFinder` can be used to find concept drifts

## ConceptEngineering
`ConceptEngineering` uses the `ConceptsDriftsFinder` to feature engineer an existing dataset.
It uses the association rules drifts to give confident rules more weight.

## Example notebooks
We run 4 different datasets with our Concept Drifting finder using association rules. See the `notebooks/` directory.
